Our goal is to explain what are negative interest rates, how do they work in practice and which are the main desired consequences. Furthermore, we aim to highlight the risks and limitations of such policy and present the reader with a brief example on Japan so he/she can connect to the issue that is being addressed.",
  "body": "#Starting Point:\r\n\r\n## What does **interest** mean? What is an **interest rate**?\r\n\r\nIn economic terms, interest is what a borrower pay to a lender for the use of an asset *on top* of the value of the same asset. In the case of borrowing money (asset), the borrower would have an obligation to pay back the amount he asked, plus some pre-defined value (agreed between the lender and the borrower) that could be a percentage of the amount lent (interest rate) over an agreed period of time.\r\n\r\nThere are two main types of interest rates:\r\n*Nominal Interest Rates\r\n*Real Interest Rates\r\nThe main difference between them is that the real interest rate takes into account that if there was inflation [concept] the value of the amount lent after a certain period of time would worth less, that is, with the same amount of money the lender could buy less goods than before.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you borrow 100€ today at a *nominal interest rate* of 10% per day, this means that if you pay back in the following day, you will pay to the lender 110€ which is the sum of the amount you asked (100€) and the interest paid on it (100*10%=10€).\r\nHowever, knowing that the *inflation* felt this last year was 5%, if you borrowed 100€ one year ago at a *nominal interest rate* of 10% per year, you will pay back today 105€ which is the sum of the amount you asked (100€) and the interest paid on it (100*10%=10€) minus the \"inflation effect\" which is given by (100*5%=5€).\r\n\r\n## What is a **negative interest rate**?\r\n\r\nA negative nominal interest rate is an instrument to promote spending, increasingly resorted to by a few central banks. Consequent to the negative interest rate, there is no incentive for consumers to save. Borrowing is more attractive, leading to a spurt in spending, there by facilitating an economic recovery. The European Central Bank (ECB), for instance, has been offering a negative nominal interest rate of -0.2% on its deposits since September 2014.\r\n \r\nMany big economies today are facing a deflation, i.e. the prices are falling. Consequently, the nominal interest rate does not represent the real interest rate. For instance, in an economy where there is a negative interest rate of -0.2% and an annual deflation of -0.6%, the real interest rate is 0.4%. This inflation/deflation-adjusted rate is referred to as the real interest rate.\r\n\r\n## What are the Mechanisms of negative interest rates? How do they work? How does the CB influence interest rates? - Lotte\r\n \r\nBanks create money by making loans, when banks stop lending because of the aftermath of financial crisis, they stop creating money. At the same time, people still repay their loans, and that results in destroying the money in the economy: the amount of money in the economy is shrinking. Therefore, it is important to stimulate the lending from banks, this can be achieved with lower interest rates. (http://positivemoney.org/how-money-works/advanced/how-quantitative-easing-works/)\r\n\r\nEspecially in recessions, lower interest rates are used as instruments to encourage business and individuals to borrow and spend. More spending leads to more demand for goods and services, and means higher employment to meet that demand. In theory this works for positive interest rates, but works this also for negative interest rates? In the case of negative interest rates, you borrow and spend € 100 today, and repay € 97 next year. This sounds attractive to create more demand for products and services. However, there is a problem with negative interest rates: nobody would lend on those terms. It would be better to keep your money in cash, because the return would be zero. In this way, the negative interest rate works as a tax on holding money. (http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/business/economy/19view.html?_r=0) \r\n\r\nA central bank influences the interest rates with monetary policies. Before the crisis of 2008-09 lowering the interest rates on excess reserves that banks keep at central banks was the main instrument. In periods of stress, the central banks reduce the overnight rate, so this will reduce the funding cost for banks and encourage them to make more loans. Making more loans will stimulate the economy, and can prevent it from slipping in a recession. However, this instrument failed during the crisis, with an overnight rate close to zero, the central banks were not able to boost the economy.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the interest rates can also be influenced with quantitative easing, experimenting started after the crisis. Central banks create money by buying securities from banks. The central banks buy assets, for example government bonds, from banks by ‘printing’ new cash. The size of bank reserves expands due to the purchase of quantity of assets: quantitative easing. By creating and pushing more money in the economy, the stock prices will raise and will decrease the interest rates. An important point to notice, is that the central bank can influence the consumer confidence. If the CB convinces the market that they are serious about the QE to fight unemployment or deflation, then it can boost economic activity by raising confidence. \r\n\r\n# What are the desired consequences? What do they want to achieve?\r\n\r\nNegative interest rates are desired for many reasons. For instance, in periods of [deflation](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deflation.asp), spending and investment tend to be lower, slowing down the aggregate demand and production and increasing unemployment. To deal with such problems, Central Banks usually use expansionary monetary policies. However, it might be the case that the deflationary process is so strong that simply keeping central bank’s interest rate at the zero lower bound is not enough to boost the economy.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a theoretical point of view, when an economy is stagnated, negative interest rates main goal is to encourage consumer spending and investment, through reduced borrowing costs for companies and households, increasing demand for loans.\r\n\r\nFirst, it is important to clarify why lending becomes cheaper and how central banks incentivize commercial banks to lend more. Commercial Banks keep reserves at Central Banks and are supposed to receive interest on those reserves. When these deposit interest rates go negative, Banks prefer earning some interest income on loans to paying interest on excess reserves at Central Banks. Moreover, banks try to get rid of these excess mandatory reserves by lending to each other and extending loans.\r\n\r\nSecondly, these lower interest rates actually aim to incentivize consumer spending. Under such circumstances, any household would prefer spending money on desired goods and services rather than paying interest to keep savings on the bank. This would contribute to higher aggregate demand and production and to improve economic growth.\r\n\r\nFinally, such situation would incentivize investment due to low cost of funding. Therefore, companies could easily invest in new facilities or R&D for instance.\r\n\r\nAnother relevant consequence of negative interest rates is the weaker currency. For instance, knowing that investors seek high interest rates to get the highest possible return on their investments and if national interest rates are negative, one may conclude that investors will try to exchange national currency for foreign currency to invest in some foreign activity. On the one hand, if many investors try to get rid of national currency, then naturally its value will decrease, leading to lower purchasing power. On the other hand, the purchasing power of the foreign currency will increase, meaning that national exports would become cheaper when expressed in this foreign currency, while foreign imports would become more expensive in terms of national currency. This would boost national exports and increase inflation – since national households would pay more for the same imported goods after all this process.\r\n\r\nHence, when setting negative interest rates, Central Banks aim to improve economic growth, increase inflation and decrease unemployment, through implicit lower borrowing costs and weaker currency.\r\n\r\n# What are the consequences/implications/risks/limits?\r\n## Consumers:\r\n\r\nNegative interest rates could have several positive implications on consumers. Firstly, the redistribution of resources from net savers to net borrowers. As net borrowers typically have a higher marginal propensity to consume, this encourages consumption. Consumers buy more goods and consequently, this leads to greater investment. However, this increase in loans increases the circulation of money in the economy, forcing prices up, which could turn out to be harmful for low-income households. Secondly, negative interest rates encourage auto loans and home mortgages. Owing to the negative interest rates, banks drop the interest rate on the mortgages they extend, which will mean better interest rates for consumers and greater expansion of low or no-down payment mortgages, which in turn would affect the housing market.\r\n \r\nHowever, there may be certain risks associated with negative interest rates for consumers. Since banks now accept riskier loans or in other words pay to accept deposits, it could decide to compensate by charging a security fee on each demand deposit account, essentially transferring the costs to the consumers. If however, banks decide to absorb all the costs, this could severely dampen their profits.\r\n \r\nIf follows that there are certain limitations to negative interest rates. While it is used as a tool to encourage consumption and investment, it would cause problems for people who store money in banks, especially those who save for retirement. If all of a sudden, the retirement savings account stops paying interest and the effect reverses, savers will end up receiving less money that they expect to receive after retirement.\r\n\r\n## Banks and other financial lenders:\r\n\r\nIn the Eurozone, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland and Japan, central banks have placed a negative rate on commercial banks excess funds that are held as a deposit at the central bank, effectively, the commercial banks have to pay to place their money there. In such a case, it is better to look for actual returns at other places. The whole idea behind the negative interest rate policies adopted by these central banks is to stimulate the economy by driving up investments. As it is not optimal to place their money at the central bank, the commercial banks go out in search for alternative assets and investments, causing investments go up and the excess funds that the commercial banks may hoard at the central bank goes down. For this reason as well, banks would rather lend to one another and interbank lending is promoted, allowing the financial market to partly finance itself instead of at the central bank.\r\n\r\n\r\nInvestments and the value of assets may increase in the presence of negative interest rates as commercial banks, lenders and other investors look for profitable assets. There is more liquidity in the financial market, in contrast to the implications for households, this is a positive environment for commercial banks to be able to grow in due to higher asset balance sheet valuations and can have a positive effect on the economy. Studies have shown that finance and economic growth have a positive relationship. However, there are risks and moral hazards involved.\r\n\r\nBy looking for other assets and investments with a return the demand for other assets increases and so do their price. Banks go in search for yield where they can find it, often accepting riskier loans and assets. This causes the overall likelihood of bank default to go up and asset bubbles to form. When the bubble bursts and consumers start being unable to payback their loans, the bank defaults when they are unable to pay back their short term debt and liabilities with their long-term illiquid assets. Commercial banks tend to sell off a large portion of their long-term assets at the same time in financial turmoil. The supply of these assets rises dramatically, causing tumbling asset prices in what is called a ‘fire sale’. This can lead to a stock market collapse. The banks can also shrink their assets by cutting off new lending to investments, which is the counter effect of what negative interest rates hope to achieve.\r\n\r\nWhen a large enough bank fails, it can cause bank runs and, similar to the financial crisis in 2008, cause a financial crisis that can lead to economic downturn. There are risks to the stability of the financial system if the banks are not regulated optimally. \r\n\r\nFor other financial lenders it can be tricky. When there’s negative interest rates, they get less money back from their investments than that is initially lent out. Rationally, such lenders would not lend out money to borrowers and there would be a shortage in liquidity available to borrowers that would want to borrow due to the low cost of borrowing. Also, this cash holding phenomena is important for banks as well, as the depositors may rather hold cash at zero nominal interest rate and withdraw their deposits, causing bank and financial instability. \r\n\r\nMany implications for commercial banks are similar to that of the consumers but in a different light. Households, consumers, the financial market and the economy are highly interconnected. One of the main functions of the financial market is to transfer funds from the households and savers to the borrowers, may it be other households, other banks or even the government. Any implications of negative interest rates affect all players involved.\r\n\r\n## Central Banks\r\n\r\nCentral Banks are using this ‘negative interest rate’ policy as an attempt to stimulate the economy when conventional monetary policy seizes to work due to zero bounded interest rates and the economy being in a liquidity trap. Since the global financial crisis, the central are using low interest rate policies to accommodate low investments, low output and low inflation. The European Central Bank has placed the deposit rate below zero and the main refinancing rate at zero in response to the persistent recession. There is a limitation to negative interest rate policies, as people would rather hold cash at zero interest rate or look for other assets with positive returns.\r\n\r\nThe Central Banks need to be mindful of the risks involved for consumers, banks and other financial intermediaries and how these risks and their subsequent behavior can affect the stability of the financial market. The Central Bank needs to keep in mind that these players do not always act rationally when conducting monetary policy and also be aware of other potential channels in which monetary policy can affect the macroeconomy through said players.\r\n\r\n# Japan\r\n\r\nSince Japanese asset price bubble collapse in early 1990s, Japan has been suffered from economic recession for a decade. It took 12 years for Japan's GDP to recover to the same level as 1995. This is commonly known as the “lost decade” of Japan. Until 2016, the country still experienced weak economic growth, stagnant price level, real wages fell and demographic issue of shrinking population.\r\n\r\nBank of Japan (BOJ) was trying to stimulate country’s economy with the zero interest rate and quantitative easing programs, to inject huge amount of money to financial system with bond-buying program. However, the result seem to work only for a short period and now the BOJ need something new.\r\n\r\nAfter experimenting many policies, in early 2016, the BOJ finally decided to adopt the negative interest rate policy, like what happens in Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland and the European Central Bank (ECB) before. The expectation is to achieve 2% target inflation. The BOJ has cut interest rates to minus 0.1%. The purpose is to reduce cost of borrowing for companies and households with rate below zero and encourage banks to lend more as cost of holding money increased and also aim for more investments from private sector. Together with this new approach, BOJ still maintain the quantitative easing policy government bond purchases. In addition, Japan’s Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, also asked for Japanese corporates to raise employees’ salary and bonus to increase household spending.\r\n\r\nHowever, some critics says that this policy might not be able to boost Japan economy. If the rate is below zero, people may take their saving out of their bank account and keep it the safe and that will not help to boost spending as the BOJ expected. With the long term deflation, for example, people have no incentive to spend money on a new car or other durable goods as they know that it will be cheaper next year. They’re like to postpone the spending plan and this will leads to the low consumption.\r\n\r\nUntil now, there is no certain proof or evidence that the consequence of negative rates policy. What’s interesting is that what will be the next move of the BOJ if the situation still not improved. The BOJ has said that there is no boundary and rates can be cut further as needed. Furthermore, some analysts even said in the near future we may see the more unexpected policy like “helicopter money policy”, injecting money directly to the people or change in policy to welcome more immigration to boost workforce.\r\n\r\n## Bibliography\r\nAdrian, T. and Shin, H.S.
