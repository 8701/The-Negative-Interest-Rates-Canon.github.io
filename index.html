What do they want to achieve?</h1>

<p>Negative interest rates are desired for many reasons. For instance, in periods of <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deflation.asp">deflation</a>, spending and investment tend to be lower, slowing down the aggregate demand and production and increasing unemployment. To deal with such problems, Central Banks usually use expansionary monetary policies. However, it might be the case that the deflationary process is so strong that simply keeping central bank’s interest rate at the zero lower bound is not enough to boost the economy.</p>

<p>From a theoretical point of view, when an economy is stagnated, negative interest rates main goal is to encourage consumer spending and investment, through reduced borrowing costs for companies and households, increasing demand for loans.</p>

<p>First, it is important to clarify why lending becomes cheaper and how central banks incentivize commercial banks to lend more. Commercial Banks keep reserves at Central Banks and are supposed to receive interest on those reserves. When these deposit interest rates go negative, Banks prefer earning some interest income on loans to paying interest on excess reserves at Central Banks. Moreover, banks try to get rid of these excess mandatory reserves by lending to each other and extending loans.</p>

<p>Secondly, these lower interest rates actually aim to incentivize consumer spending. Under such circumstances, any household would prefer spending money on desired goods and services rather than paying interest to keep savings on the bank. This would contribute to higher aggregate demand and production and to improve economic growth.</p>

<p>Finally, such situation would incentivize investment due to low cost of funding. Therefore, companies could easily invest in new facilities or R&amp;D for instance.</p>

<p>Another relevant consequence of negative interest rates is the weaker currency. For instance, knowing that investors seek high interest rates to get the highest possible return on their investments and if national interest rates are negative, one may conclude that investors will try to exchange national currency for foreign currency to invest in some foreign activity. On the one hand, if many investors try to get rid of national currency, then naturally its value will decrease, leading to lower purchasing power. On the other hand, the purchasing power of the foreign currency will increase, meaning that national exports would become cheaper when expressed in this foreign currency, while foreign imports would become more expensive in terms of national currency. This would boost national exports and increase inflation – since national households would pay more for the same imported goods after all this process.</p>

<p>Hence, when setting negative interest rates, Central Banks aim to improve economic growth, increase inflation and decrease unemployment, through implicit lower borrowing costs and weaker currency.</p>
