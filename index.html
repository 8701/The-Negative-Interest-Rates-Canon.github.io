</h2>

<p>Before explaining in more detail how negative interest rates work, one must understand what an interest rate is. In economic terms, interest is what a borrower pays to a lender for the use of an <b id="a1"><a href="#f1">asset</a></b>  on top of the value of the same asset. In the case of borrowing money (example of asset), the borrower would have an obligation to pay back the amount he asked for, plus some pre-defined value (agreed between the lender and the borrower) that could be a percentage of the amount lent (interest rate), over an agreed period of time.</p>

<p>It is also important to distinguish nominal interest rates from real interest rates. The main difference between them is that the real interest rate takes into account <b id="a2"><a href="#f2">inflation</a></b> - which means that with the same amount of money the lender would be able to buy fewer goods now than before. In other words, the real interest rate is what we, consumers, really experience in our daily life.</p>

<p>For example, if you borrow 100€ one year ago at a nominal interest rate of 10% per year, you will pay back to the lender 110€ which is the sum of the amount you asked (100€) and the interest paid on it (100x10%=10€).</p>

<p>However, if you borrowed 100€ one year ago at a nominal interest rate of 10% per year and you know that the inflation felt this last year was 5%, what you will <em>really</em> pay back today is 105€. This value comes from the sum of the amount you asked (100€) and the interest paid on it (100x10%=10€) minus the inflation effect which is given by (100x5%=5€).</p>

<p>Now, picture that same upside-down World, where instead of paying interest you are actually receiving its value! Assuming  a nominal negative interest rate of (-10%), and no inflation, instead of paying back 110€ you would only pay back 90€. Sounds crazy right? </p>

</h2>

<p>Firstly, consider a <em>simplified</em> financial environment within a country (or region). It is primarly composed of three agents: a <b id="a3"><a href="#f3">Central Bank</a></b>, <b id="a4"><a href="#f4">Commercial Banks</a></b> and consumers, just like you.</p>

<p>These three agents are interconnected in such a way that a lending/borrowing rate that one sets affects the others. The flowchart given below explains this relationship:</p>

<div><img src="https://github.com/RicardoGabriel/first-repo/blob/master/Image1.png" width="800"></div>

<p><a href="https://postimg.org/image/rb89sw5kv/"><img src="https://s11.postimg.org/h15utnfpf/Image1.png" alt="Image1.png"></a></p>

<p>Starting with the Central Bank, besides setting <b id="a6"><a href="#f6">monetary policy</a></b> for a region, it also sets the policy rates (the official bank (lending) rate and deposit rate) for the commercial banks (relation 1). Most Central Banks demand that commercial banks maintain a minimum level of <b id="a5"><a href="#f5">reserves</a></b> (so called required reserves) in order to meet their operating needs and as a measure of safety for unexpected events such as huge cash withdrawals by Consumers. Central Banks pay interest on excess reserves, those above the required minimum, at the <em>official deposit rate</em>. In this scenario, a negative deposit rate means that banks are charged for saving their excess reserves.</p>

<p>However there may be some Commercial Banks that need help meeting their reserve requirement and, as a last resort, they may borrow from the Central Bank at the <em>official lending rate</em>. Here, a negative lending rate implies that borrowing is now cheaper for Commercial Banks.</p>

<p>To meet reserve requirements, Commercial Banks can also borrow from one another at the so-called interbank market (overnight) rate (relation 2). This rate is closely determined by the policy rates set by the Central Bank, where its deposit rate acts as a floor (when lending to other banks, Commercial Banks will charge at least as much as they would earn by saving the same amount at the Central Bank) and its lending rate acts as a ceiling (as Banks would not want to pay more to borrow from other Banks than what they would pay the Central Bank). In this context, a negative interbank rate implies that although banks can borrow more cheaply from each other, they also have to pay interest on the excess liquidity they loan out to other banks, keeping the net profit zero.</p>

<p>Finally, this interbank rate (or the borrowing cost for Commercial Banks) determines the borrowing rates for Consumers (relation 3). A negative borrowing rate may sound really attractive as you are <em>paid to borrow</em>, but the net effect on consumers is uncertain if banks decide to compensate it by charging a deposit fee for the negative interest rates they face. <a href="http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking/pages/macroeconomic-insights-folder/negative-interest-rates-101/img-01-slide.png">#</a></p>

<p>To sum up, the three entities presented above are interconnected in such a way that a rate set by the Central Banks influences the other two. Look at an example graph below:</p>

<div><img src="https://github.com/RicardoGabriel/first-repo/blob/master/Image2.png" width="800"></div>

<p><a href="https://postimg.org/image/kbzjtv1af/"><img src="https://s15.postimg.org/xg546jtcb/Image2.png" alt="Image2.png"></a></p>

<p>For instance, if the rate on the deposits at the central bank increases, then banks will lend to one another at a higher rate, making its costs of borrowing higher, and therefore the rate at which consumers borrow may also increase. However, a higher interbank borrowing rate does not necessarily imply an equally higher consumer borrowing rate as shown in the graph above, as it is determined by other factors such as the bank’s operating costs, credit risk, regulatory requirements etc. </p>

</h2>

<p>Negative interest rates have been used when conventional monetary policy ceases to work properly. For instance, this could happen in periods of deep deflation (price levels fall), when consumer spending and investment tend to be lower, slowing down the <b id="a9"><a href="#f9">aggregate demand</a></b> and production and increasing unemployment. To deal with such problems, Central Banks usually use  <b id="a10"><a href="#f10">expansionary monetary policies</a></b>. However, it might be the case that simply keeping central bank’s interest rate at the zero lower bound  or using <b id="a7"><a href="#f7">quantitative easing</a></b> is not enough to boost the economy.</p>

<p>Therefore, from a theoretical point of view, when an economy is stagnated, negative interest rates main goal is to encourage consumer spending and investment, through reduced borrowing costs for companies and households, increasing the number of loans made.</p>

<p>First, it is important to clarify why lending becomes cheaper and how Central Banks incentivize Commercial Banks to lend more. Remember that Commercial Banks keep reserves at Central Banks and they expect to receive interest on the excess reserves. When these deposit interest rates go negative, Banks prefer to earn some interest income on loans instead of paying interest on excess reserves at Central Banks. On the other hand, this also probably leads to lower funding cost for Commercial Banks, encouraging them to borrow more from one another. </p>

<p>Secondly, these lower interest rates actually aim to incentivize consumer spending. Under such circumstances, any household would prefer spending money on desired goods and services rather than paying to keep savings in the Bank. This would contribute to higher aggregate demand and production while improving economic growth.</p>

<p>Finally, such situation would incentivize investment due to the low cost of funding, since the interest rates charged to the general public could also decrease. Therefore, companies could easily invest in new facilities or R&amp;D for instance and entrepreneurs could start new businesses.</p>

<p>Another relevant consequence of negative interest rates is that the currency becomes weaker. For instance, knowing that investors seek high-interest rates to get the highest possible return on their investments and if national interest rates are negative, one may conclude that investors will try to exchange national currency for foreign currency (to invest in some foreign activity that yields higher return). On the one hand, if many investors try to get rid of a national currency, then naturally its value will decrease, leading to lower purchasing power - foreign imports would become more expensive in terms of national currency. On the other hand, the purchasing power of the foreign currency will increase, meaning that national exports would become cheaper when expressed in this foreign currency. All of this together would boost national exports – national products became cheaper for foreigners and its demand would therefore increase – and increase inflation – since national households would pay more for the same imported goods after all.</p>

<p>Hence, when setting negative interest rates, <strong>Central Banks aim to improve economic growth, increase inflation, demand and output and decrease unemployment</strong>, through implicit lower borrowing costs for banks and consumers.</p>

<b id="b5"><strong>Consumers:</strong></b> <a href="#i5">↩</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If consumers face negative interest rates, they have no incentive to save. Borrowing is more attractive, leading to an increase in spending, thereby facilitating an economic recovery. Negative interest rates could also have several <strong>positive implications</strong> on consumers. Let us look to some of them.</p>

<p>Firstly, the transfer of resources from net savers to net borrowers. As net borrowers typically have a higher marginal propensity to consume (i.e. they consume more for every unit of income that they earn than net savers encouraging consumption) they will buy more goods and services this leads to greater investment.</p>

<p>Secondly, negative interest rates encourage auto loans (loans taken to purchase automobiles) and home mortgages. Owing to the negative interest rates, Banks drop the interest rate on the mortgages they extend, which will mean lower interest rates for consumers, which in turn leads to a greater expansion of cheaper mortgages. This, in turn would positively affect the housing market due to greater demand.</p>

<p>There are also certain <strong>negative implications</strong> associated with negative interest rates for Consumers.</p>

<p>Since Banks now accept riskier loans, they could decide to compensate this risk by charging a security fee on each loan they lend out, essentially passing on the costs to the consumers. If instead, banks decide to absorb these costs, this could severely decrease their profits.</p>

<p>It follows that there are certain limitations to negative interest rates. While it is used as a tool to encourage consumption and investment, it would cause problems for people who store money in banks, especially those who save for retirement. If all of a sudden, the retirement savings account stops paying interest and the effect reverses, savers will end up receiving less money that they expect to receive after retirement.</p>

<p>All of these factors also lead to an increase in money circulation,  which forces prices to go up. This increase in inflation could turn out to be harmful for low-income households, who are typically net savers.</p>

<p>Overall, the net effect that negative interest rates have on consumers is not cristal clear. While consumers can benefit when they are paid whenever they borrow, the same effect reverses if banks charge them with a fee, causing the effective interest rate to be zero. <a href="http://www.advisoryhq.com/articles/negative-interest-rates/">#1</a> <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/080916/how-negative-interest-rates-can-affect-consumers.asp">#2</a></p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>As with consumers, the negative interest rates have implications for commercial banks and other financial lenders. Many of these implications are similar to the ones for consumers but in a different light. Households, consumers, the financial market and the economy are highly interconnected as talked about previously. One of the main functions of the financial market is to transfer money from the households and savers to the borrowers, may it be other households, other banks or even the government. Any implications of negative interest rates affect all players involved.</p>

<p>In the Eurozone, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland and Japan, the central banks have placed a negative rate on commercial banks excess reserves that are held as a deposit at the central bank. In other words, the commercial banks have to pay to place their money there. In such a case, it is better to look for positive returns at other places. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0048beea-766e-11e6-bf48-b372cdb1043a">#</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32284393">#</a></p>

<p>One of the ideas behind the negative interest rate policies adopted by these Central Banks is to stimulate the economy by driving up investments, as we have previously mentioned. As it is not optimal to place their money at the Central Bank, the Commercial Banks go out in search for alternative assets and investments. Commercial Banks may use these extra funds on R&amp;D investments and loans to entrepreneurs, for example. The banks would also rather lend to one another because of the negative interest rate at the central bank - so interbank lending is promoted, allowing the financial market to partly finance itself.</p>

<p>Investments and the value of assets increase in the presence of negative interest rates as Commercial Banks, lenders and other investors look for more profitable assets. There is more <b id="a11"><a href="#f11">liquidity</a></b> in the financial market, in contrast to the implications for households, this is a positive environment for Commercial Banks to be able to grow in. It can also have a positive effect on the economy. Studies <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/res/seminars/2009/arc/pdf/adrian.pdf">#1</a> <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr398.pdf">#2</a> <a href="http://www.bis.org/publ/work268.htm">#3</a> have shown that finance and economic growth have a positive relationship. However, there are risks and  <b id="a12"><a href="#f12">moral hazards</a></b> involved. <a href="http://moore.sc.edu/UserFiles/moore/Documents/Finance/Berger/BankLiquidityCreationMonetaryPolicyandFinancialCrises.pdf">#</a></p>

<p>By looking for other assets and investments with a positive return, its demand increases and so do their prices. Banks go in search of returns where they can find it, often accepting riskier loans and assets where they give out loans to people that have a higher chance of not being able to pay back the loan, i.e. with higher default risk. This phenomena is called ‘searching for yield’. </p>

<p>This causes the overall likelihood of <b id="a13"><a href="#f13">bank default</a></b> to go up and <b id="a14"><a href="#f14">asset bubbles</a></b> to form. When the bubble bursts and Consumers start being unable to payback their loans, the Bank defaults as it is unable to pay back their liabilities (debts) due to not getting enough money from their borrowers. And when a large enough bank defaults, it can cause <b id="a15"><a href="#f15">bank runs</a></b> and, similarly to the financial crisis in 2008-2009, cause a financial crisis that can lead to a <b id="a8"><a href="#f8">recession</a></b> - if Banks are not regulated optimally, it endangerous the stability of the financial system. <a href="https://www.macroeconomics.tu-berlin.de/fileadmin/fg124/Regulation/Hanson-Kashyap-Stein-2011.pdf">#</a></p>

<p>For other financial lenders, when there are negative interest rates, they get less money back from their investments than what is actually lent out. Rationally, lenders would rather not lend out money. So, there would be a shortage of liquidity available to borrowers that would want to borrow due to the low cost of funding. This cash holding phenomena is important for banks, as the depositors may rather hold cash at zero nominal interest rate and withdraw their deposits, also causing financial instability.</p>

<p>Since Japanese asset bubble collapse in the early 1990s, <strong>Japan</strong> has been in an economic recession. It took 12 years for Japan's GDP to recover to the same level as 1995. This is commonly known as the <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2012/08/lost-decades">lost decade</a> of Japan. Even in the current year of 2016, the country still experiences weak economic growth, stagnated price level and real wages.</p>

<p>Bank of Japan (BOJ) first tried to stimulate country’s economy with a zero interest rate and quantitative easing programs. However, the result seemed to work only for a short period of time. For this reason, in early 2016, the BOJ decided to adopt a negative interest rate policy, with the expectation to achieve a 2% inflation rate. The BOJ has not only cut interest rate on excess reserve deposits to minus 0.1%, as it still maintains the quantitative easing program.<a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/06/06/national/stimulus-efforts-struggle-abe-pushes-equal-pay-lift-japans-economy/#.WAnzEvmrhBc">#</a></p>

<p>Some critics say that this set of policies might not be able to boost Japan’s economy due to the long term deflation and that the BOJ may be running out of monetary policy tools. However, until now, there is no clear proof or evidence about the consequences of the use of negative interest rates. <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-06/japan-is-fast-approaching-the-quantitative-limits-of-quantitative-easing">#</a></p>

<p>Recently, the BOJ said that there is no boundary and rates can be cut further as needed and additional measures, such as support more immigration in order to boost Japanese workforce, had been discussed as well. <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/01/06/national/social-issues/government-weighs-immigration-maintain-population-boost-workforce/#.WAn1y_mrhBc">#</a></p>

<p>The <strong>Eurozone</strong> sovereign debt crisis began at the end of 2009, when eurozone member states Greece, Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus were unable to repay or refinance their government debt. As a result some countries did not fully recovered and the Eurozone is still facing a period of low inflation and low GDP growth. <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/european-sovereign-debt-crisis.asp">#</a></p>

<p>With the single monetary policy from the European Central Bank (ECB) Eurozone member states' governments can't independently make monetary policy decisions, so they can't use it to economically recover themselves. Taking this into account, the ECB cut bank rates in several steps during 2012–2013 in order to boost inflation and to stimulate growth. However, the Eurozone economy was still weak so, in June 2014, the ECB became the world’s first major central bank to launch negative interest rates, cutting its depositary interest rate to minus 0.1% and more recently (March, 2016) to minus 0.4%. <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/040215/understanding-negative-rates-europes-central-banks.asp">#</a></p>

<p>Representatives from the European Central Bank tell us that most of the consequences felt so far, point towards a successful achievement of economic growth. For instance, the net income of euro area significant banking groups actually increased between 2014 and 2015. <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2016/html/sp160728.en.html">#</a></p>

<p>Adding to the recent financial crisis, the reasons behind the ECB’s decision are quite similar to BOJ's ones. Both regions are mature economies with fewer investment opportunities and a similar demographic problem (the working age population is diminishing).<a href="http://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/japan-in-transition-rest-of-world-watches-as-country-tries-negative-interest-rates-to-spur-economy">#</a> Moreover, in both cases it is difficult to say how long these low interest rates will continue and what the real consequences for the economies would be. <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/06/negative-rates-will-stay-for-another-five-years-jpmorgan-warns.html">#</a></p>

<a id="are-there-any-alternatives-" class="anchor" href="#are-there-any-alternatives-" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><b id="b9">Are there any alternatives?</b> <a href="#i9">↩</a>
</h2>

<p>Given all the limitations of negative interest rates, one may ask himself if there are alternatives to their use. Well, economies can not only be stimulated by monetary policy, but also by <strong><b id="a16"><a href="#f16">fiscal policy</a></b></strong>. Governments have their own revenue, generated from taxes paid by households and firms, and also spend a lot of money, on transfers and subsidies for example. </p>

<p>Fiscal policy is a tool used by Governments to target the value and composition of government spending and revenue. When a policy authority decides to lower taxes and increase spending, it is implicitly increasing the amount of money circulating, hooping to increase demand, investment and economic growth. </p>

<p>Some economists argue that, instead of relying so much on monetary policy and hoping that Central Banks will boost the economic growth, governments should use fiscal policy to overcome stagnation. However, this tool also has several limitations. </p>

<p>First, one must keep in mind that the government budget should be balanced - the value of revenues should equal more or less the value of spendings. So when a government faces economic stagnation and has already a considerable 
<b id="a17"><a href="#f17">budget deficit</a></b>, fiscal policy is somehow limited.</p>

<p>Second, if in this case it chooses to use an expansionary fiscal policy anyway, it will have an even higher budget deficit. This might mean that, in the future, the government will raise taxes and decrease spending to pay this debt. Moreover, households may be aware of this situation and, instead of spending the money they accumulated from the previous decrease in taxes, they will save it to face its future increase.</p>

<p>To sum up, although Fiscal Policy can be seen as an instrument to spur economic growth, under certain circumstances, it also has some limitations and might end up not having the desired consequences. <a href="http://www.economicshelp.org/macroeconomics/fiscal-policy/fiscal_policy/">#1</a> <a href="https://media.spglobal.com/documents/SPGlobal_Negative_Interest_Rates_August_2016.pdf%20pages%2014-16">#2</a></p>

<p>Another alternative to negative interest rates is described in Milton Friedman’s theory Helicopter Drop - <strong>Helicopter Money</strong>. In his famous paper The Optimum Quantity of Money, Friedman says &gt; Let us suppose now that one day a helicopter flies over this community and drops an additional $1,000 in bills from the sky, which is, of course, hastily collected by members of the community. Let us suppose further that everyone is convinced that this is a unique event which will never be repeated.&lt; <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/08/what-is-helicopter-money/">#</a></p>

<p>Within the frameworks of today’s economies, this idea could be materialized by allowing the Central Banks to transfer money directly to households, by crediting their bank  accounts for instance. By doing so, Central Banks would be stimulating demand, inflation and probably economic growth. However, some people argue that actually helicopter money works as fiscal policy and not as a monetary policy. As it is known, Central Banks are only in charge of monetary policy and strictly forbidden to interfere with fiscal policy. Therefore, such measure would be extremely controversial. <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/08/what-is-helicopter-money/">#</a></p>

<p>Helicopter money can also be interpreted as tax cuts financed by monetary policy. Ben Bernanke and Willem Buiter defend that the government could decrease taxes if central banks commit to purchase government debt. It is important to distinguish this from quantitative easing. With quantitative easing central banks buy assets that the governments have to pay back. However, according to this theory, the bonds issued by the governments would be <b id="a18"><a href="#f18">perpetual bonds</a></b> at an interest rate of zero. Therefore, while the central banks would buy and hold these assets forever, the governments would not have to pay back the loan neither interest. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/29/upshot/helicopter-money-why-some-economists-are-talking-about-dropping-money-from-the-sky.html?_r=0">#</a> </p>

<p>However, as Willem Buiter claims, coordination between the central bank and the government is required for the real-world implementation of helicopter money drops. The fact that governments may get used to get this type funding to finance investments or tax cuts and that this could also lead to an inflation rate much higher than the 2% currently desired also concern policy makers and economists. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/helicopter-money">#</a></p>

Let say that the maturity date is 5 years from now. So you will get $100 every year as interest and after 5 years you will get $1000 as well. A Perpetual bond is a bond which has no maturity date. So you will not get that $1000 after 5 years but the advantage is that you will receive a steady stream of interest payments forever. Usually the interest rate on such bonds are low.  <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/perpetualbond.asp">Learn More</a> <a href="#a18">↩</a></p>
