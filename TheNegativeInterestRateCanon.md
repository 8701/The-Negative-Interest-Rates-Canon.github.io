# Starting Point:

## What is an Interest Rate?

Before explaining in more detail how negative interest rates work, one must understand what an interest rate is. In economic terms, interest is what a borrower pays to a lender for the use of an <sup id="a1">[asset](#myfootnote1)</sup>  on top of the value of the same asset. In the case of borrowing money (asset), the borrower would have an obligation to pay back the amount he asked for, plus some pre-defined value (agreed between the lender and the borrower) that could be a percentage of the amount lent (interest rate), over an agreed period of time.

It is also important to distinguish nominal interest rates from real interest rates. The main difference between them is that the real interest rate takes into account inflation effect - which means that with the same amount of money the lender would be able to buy fewer goods than before, at the lending date. In other words, the real interest rate is what we, consumers, really experience in our daily life.

For example, if you borrow 100€ one year ago at a nominal interest rate of 10% per year, you will pay back to the lender 110€ which is the sum of the amount you asked (100€) and the interest paid on it (100x10%=10€).

However, if you borrowed 100€ one year ago at a nominal interest rate of 10% per year and knowing that the inflation felt this last year was 5%, what you will really pay back today is 105€. This value comes from the sum of the amount you asked (100€) and the interest paid on it (100x10%=10€) minus the inflation effect which is given by (100x5%=5€).

Now, picture an upside-down World, where instead of paying interest you are actually receiving its value! Assuming  a nominal negative interest rate of (-10%), in the first example, instead of paying back 110€, you would only pay back 90€. Sounds crazy right? 

#### How would this happen? Why would this happen? That is what you will learn with this canon!

# Taking Off:

First, we need to understand how does a simplified financial environment within a country or region work and that it is mainly composed of three agents: a Central Bank, Commercial Banks and Consumers.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://github.com/RicardoGabriel/first-repo/blob/master/Image1.png" width="1000"></div>

Most central banks demand that commercial banks maintain a minimum level of reserves (required reserves) to preserve liquidity and solvency against any unexpected event, such as bank runs. Commercial banks hold a portion of their reserves at the central bank, who pays interest on those required reserves and/or on excess reserves, above the required minimum [Relation 1.a]

However there may be some commercial banks that need help meeting their reserve requirement and, as a last resort, they may borrow from the central bank at the official lending rate [Relation 1.b]

To meet reserve requirements, commercial banks can also borrow from one another at interbank market overnight rate [Relation 2]. Which is always higher than the rate on the deposits at the central bank (such they can make a profit) and lower than central bank’s lending rate (such it is still preferred …).

Commercial banks’ own borrowing costs, operating costs and regulatory requirements are some of the factors which affect the commercial banks’ lending rate to consumers [Relation 3]

As you can see in the previous figure, these three important relations that we just wrote about are highly interconnected. For instances, if the rate on the deposits at the central bank increase, then banks will lend to one another at a higher rate making its costs of borrowing higher, therefore consumers borrowing rates could increase.


## What are the Mechanisms of negative interest rates? How do they work? How does the CB influence interest rates?
 
Banks create money by making loans when banks stop lending because of the aftermath of financial crisis, they stop creating money. At the same time, people still repay their loans, and that results in destroying the money in the economy: the amount of money in the economy is shrinking. Therefore, it is important to stimulate the lending from banks, this can be achieved with lower interest rates.

Especially in recessions, lower interest rates are used as instruments to encourage business and individuals to borrow and spend. More spending leads to more demand for goods and services and means higher employment to meet that demand. In theory, this works for positive interest rates, but works this also for negative interest rates? In the case of negative interest rates, you borrow and spend € 100 today, and repay € 97 next year. This sounds attractive to create more demand for products and services. However, there is a problem with negative interest rates: nobody would lend on those terms. It would be better to keep your money in cash because the return would be zero. In this way, the negative interest rate works as a tax on holding money. 

A central bank influences the interest rates with monetary policies. Before the crisis of 2008-09 lowering the interest rates on excess reserves that banks keep at central banks was the main instrument. In periods of stress, the central banks reduce the overnight rate, so this will reduce the funding cost for banks and encourage them to make more loans. Making more loans will stimulate the economy, and can prevent it from slipping into a recession. However, this instrument failed during the crisis, with an overnight rate close to zero, the central banks were not able to boost the economy.

On the other hand, the interest rates can also be influenced with quantitative easing, experimenting started after the crisis. Central banks create money by buying securities from banks. The central banks buy assets, for example, government bonds, from banks by ‘printing’ new cash. The size of bank reserves expands due to the purchase of a quantity of assets: quantitative easing. By creating and pushing more money into the economy, the stock prices will rise and will decrease the interest rates. An important point to notice is that the central bank can influence the consumer confidence. If the CB convinces the market that they are serious about the QE to fight unemployment or deflation, then it can boost economic activity by raising confidence. 

## What are the desired consequences? What do they want to achieve?

Negative interest rates are used for many reasons. For instance, in periods of deflation, consumer spending and investment tend to be lower, slowing down the aggregate demand and production and increasing unemployment. To deal with such problems, central banks usually use expansionary monetary policies. However, it might be the case that the deflation felt is so strong that simply keeping central bank’s interest rate at the zero lower bound is not enough to boost the economy.

From a theoretical point of view, when an economy is stagnated, negative interest rates main goal is to encourage consumer spending and investment, through reduced borrowing costs for companies and households, increasing the number of loans made.

First, it is important to clarify why lending becomes cheaper and how central banks incentivize commercial banks to lend more. Remember that commercial banks keep reserves at central banks and are supposed to receive interest on those reserves. When these deposit interest rates go negative, banks prefer to earn some interest income on loans instead of paying interest on excess reserves at Central Banks. Moreover, banks try to get rid of these excess mandatory reserves by lending to each other and extending loans.

Secondly, these lower interest rates actually aim to incentivize consumer spending. Under such circumstances, any household would prefer spending money on desired goods and services rather than paying to keep savings in the bank. This would contribute to higher aggregate demand and production and improve economic growth.

Finally, such situation would incentivize investment due to the low cost of funding. Therefore, companies could easily invest in new facilities or R&D.

Another relevant consequence of negative interest rates is the weaker currency. For instance, knowing that investors seek high-interest rates to get the highest possible return on their investments and if national interest rates are negative, one may conclude that investors will try to exchange (trade?) national currency for foreign currency to invest in some foreign activity. On the one hand, if many investors try to get rid of a national currency, then naturally its value will decrease, leading to lower purchasing power. On the other hand, the purchasing power of the foreign currency will increase, meaning that national exports would become cheaper when expressed in this foreign currency, while foreign imports would become more expensive in terms of national currency. This would **boost national exports** and **increase inflation** – since national households would pay more for the same imported goods after all this process.

Hence, when setting negative interest rates, central banks aim to improve economic growth, increase inflation and decrease unemployment, through implicit lower borrowing costs for banks and consumers and a weaker currency.

## What are the consequences/implications/risks/limits?

* Consumers:

(Consequent to the negative interest rate, there is no incentive for consumers to save. Borrowing is more attractive, leading to a spurt in spending, thereby facilitating an economic recovery.)

Negative interest rates could have several positive implications on consumers. 

Firstly, the redistribution of resources from net savers to net borrowers. As net borrowers typically have a higher marginal propensity to consume, this encourages consumption. Consumers buy more goods and consequently, this leads to greater investment. However, this increase in loans increases the circulation of money in the economy, forcing prices up, which could turn out to be harmful to low-income households. 

Secondly, negative interest rates encourage auto loans and home mortgages. Owing to the negative interest rates, banks drop the interest rate on the mortgages they extend, which will mean better interest rates for consumers and greater expansion of low or no-down payment mortgages, which in turn would affect the housing market.

However, there may be certain risks associated with negative interest rates for consumers. Since banks now accept riskier loans or, in other words, pay to accept deposits, it could decide to compensate by charging a security fee on each demand deposit account, essentially transferring the costs to the consumers. If however, banks decide to absorb all the costs, this could severely dampen their profits.

If follows that there are certain limitations to negative interest rates. While it is used as a tool to encourage consumption and investment, it would cause problems for people who save money in banks, especially those who save for retirement. If all of a sudden, the retirement savings account stops paying interest and the effect reverses, savers will end up receiving less money that they expect to receive after retirement.

* Banks and other financial lenders:

In the Eurozone, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland and Japan, central banks have placed a negative rate on commercial banks excess funds that are held as a deposit at the central bank, in other words, the commercial banks have to pay to place their money there. In such a case, it is better to look for positive returns at other places.

One of the ideas behind the negative interest rate policies adopted by these central banks is to stimulate the economy by driving up investments. As it is not optimal to place their money at the central bank, the commercial banks go out in search for alternative assets and investments, causing investments go up and the excess funds that the commercial banks may hoard at the central bank go down. For this reason, as well, banks would rather lend to one another - interbank lending is promoted, allowing the financial market to partly finance itself.

Investments and the value of assets may increase in the presence of negative interest rates as commercial banks, lenders and other investors look for profitable assets. There is more liquidity in the financial market, in contrast to the implications for households, this is a positive environment for commercial banks to be able to grow in due to higher asset balance sheet valuations and can have a positive effect on the economy. Studies have shown that finance and economic growth have a positive relationship. However, there are risks and moral hazards involved.

By looking for other assets and investments with a positive return, the demand for other assets increases and so do their prices. Banks go in search for yield where they can find it, often accepting riskier loans and assets. This causes the overall likelihood of bank default to go up and asset bubbles to form. When the bubble bursts and consumers start being unable to payback their loans, the bank defaults when they are unable to pay back their short-term debt and liabilities with their long-term illiquid assets. Commercial banks tend to sell off a large portion of their long-term assets at the same time in financial turmoil. The supply of these assets rises dramatically, causing tumbling asset prices in what is called a ‘fire sale’. This can lead to a stock market collapse. The banks can also shrink their assets by cutting off new lending to investments, which is the counter effect of what negative interest rates hope to achieve.

When a large enough bank fails, it can cause bank runs and, similar to the financial crisis in 2008, cause a financial crisis that can lead to economic downturn. There are risks to the stability of the financial system if the banks are not regulated optimally.

For other financial lenders, it can be tricky. When there are negative interest rates, they get less money back from their investments than that is initially lent out. Rationally, such lenders would not lend out money to borrowers and there would be a shortage of liquidity available to borrowers that would want to borrow due to the low cost of borrowing. Also, this cash holding phenomena is important for banks as well, as the depositors may rather hold cash at zero nominal interest rate and withdraw their deposits, causing bank and financial instability.

Many implications for commercial banks are similar to that of the consumers but in a different light. Households, consumers, the financial market and the economy are highly interconnected. One of the main functions of the financial market is to transfer funds from the households and savers to the borrowers, may it be other households, other banks or even the government. Any implications of negative interest rates affect all players involved.

* Central Banks

Central Banks are using this ‘negative interest rate’ policy as an attempt to stimulate the economy when conventional monetary policy seizes to work due to zero bounded interest rates and the economy being in a liquidity trap. Since the global financial crisis, the central are using low-interest rate policies to accommodate low investments, low output, and low inflation. The European Central Bank has placed the deposit rate below zero and the main refinancing rate at zero in response to the persistent recession. There is a limitation to negative interest rate policies, as people would rather hold cash at zero interest rate or look for other assets with positive returns.

The Central Banks need to be mindful of the risks involved for consumers, banks and other financial intermediaries and how these risks and their subsequent behavior can affect the stability of the financial market. The Central Bank needs to keep in mind that these players do not always act rationally when conducting monetary policy and also be aware of other potential channels in which monetary policy can affect the macroeconomy through said players.

## Japan

Since Japanese asset price bubble collapse in the early 1990s, Japan has been suffered from economic recession for a decade. It took 12 years for Japan's GDP to recover to the same level as 1995. This is commonly known as the “lost decade” of Japan. Until 2016, the country still experienced weak economic growth, stagnant price level, real wages fell and the demographic issue of shrinking population.

Bank of Japan (BOJ) was trying to stimulate country’s economy with the zero interest rate and quantitative easing programs, to inject a huge amount of money to financial system with the bond-buying program. However, the result seems to work only for a short period and now the BOJ need something new.

After experimenting many policies, in early 2016, the BOJ finally decided to adopt the negative interest rate policy, like what happens in Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland and the European Central Bank (ECB) before. The expectation is to achieve 2% target inflation. The BOJ has cut interest rates to minus 0.1%. The purpose is to reduce the cost of borrowing for companies and households with a rate below zero and encourage banks to lend more as the cost of holding money increased and also aim for more investments from the private sector. Together with this new approach, BOJ still maintains the quantitative easing policy government bond purchases. In addition, Japan’s Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, also asked for Japanese corporates to raise employees’ salary and bonus to increase household spending.

However, some critics say that this policy might not be able to boost Japan economy. If the rate is below zero, people may take their saving out of their bank account and keep it the safe and that will not help to boost spending as the BOJ expected. With the long-term deflation, for example, people have no incentive to spend money on a new car or other durable goods as they know that it will be cheaper next year. They’re like to postpone the spending plan and this will lead to the low consumption.

Until now, there is no certain proof or evidence that the consequence of negative rates policy. What’s interesting is that what will be the next move of the BOJ if the situation still not improved. The BOJ has said that there is no boundary and rates can be cut further as needed. Furthermore, some analysts even said in the near future we may see the most unexpected policy like “helicopter money policy”, injecting money directly to the people or change in policy to welcome more immigration to boost workforce.

## Alternatives

Given all the limitations of negative interest rates, one may ask himself if there are alternatives to their use. Well, economies can not only be stimulated by monetary policy, but also by fiscal policy. Governments have their own revenue, generated from taxes paid by households and firms, and also spend a lot of money, on transfers and subsidies for example. 

Fiscal policy is a tool used by Governments to target the value and composition of government spending and revenue. When a policy authority decides to lower taxes and increase spending, it is implicitly increasing the money circulating, hooping to increase demand, investment and economic growth. Some economists argue that governments, instead of relying so much on monetary policy and hoping that central banks will boost the economy, should make more use of fiscal policy to overcome stagnation. This seems to solve our problem. However, fiscal policy has a lot of limitation. First, one must keep in mind that the government budget should be balanced - the value of revenues should equal more or less the value of spending. So when a government faces economic stagnation and has already a considerable budget deficit, fiscal policy is somehow limited. Second, if in this case it chooses to use an expansionary fiscal policy anyway, it will have an even higher budget deficit, meaning that, in the future, the government will probably raise taxes and decrease spending to pay this debt. Moreover, households may be aware of this situation and, instead of spending the money they accumulated, they will save to face the future increase in taxes. To sum up, although Fiscal Policy can be seen as an instrument to spur economic growth, it also has some limitations.
Another substitute of negative interest rates is described in Milton Friedman’s theory Helicopter Money. In his famous paper The Optimum Quantity of Money, Friedman says Let us suppose now that one day a helicopter flies over this community and drops an additional $1,000 in bills from the sky, which is, of course, hastily collected by members of the community. Let us suppose further that everyone is convinced that this is a unique event which will never be repeated. Within the frameworks of today’s economies, this idea could be materialized by allowing the central banks to transfer money directly to households, by crediting their bank  accounts for instance. By doing so, central banks would be stimulating demand, inflation and probably economic growth. However, some people argue that helicopter money works in fact as a fiscal policy and not as a monetary policy. As it is known, central banks are only in charge of monetary policy and strictly forbidden to interfere with fiscal policy. So such measure would be extremely controversial. 
Helicopter money can also be interpreted as tax cuts financed by monetary policy. Ben Bernanke and Willem Buiter defend that the government could decrease taxes if central banks commit to purchase government debt. It is important to distinguish this from what many governments have been doing with quantitative easing before the negative interest rates. With quantitative easing central banks buy assets that the governments have to pay back. However, according to this theory, the bonds issued by the governments would be perpetual bonds at an interest rate of zero. Therefore, while the central banks would buy and hold these assets forever, the governments would not pay back the loan neither interest. However, as Willem Buiter claims, coordination between the central bank and the government is required for the real-world implementation of helicopter money drops. The fact that governments may get used to get this type funding to finance investments or tax cuts for instance also concern policy makers and economists.
